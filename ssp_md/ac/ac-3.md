# ac-3 - \[Access Control\] Access Enforcement

## Control Statement

Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

## Control Assessment Objective

approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources are enforced in accordance with applicable access control policies.

## Control guidance

Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection ( [PE](#pe) ) family.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

Access control policy is enforced through the application's role-based access control component. This examines record level restrictions for teacher, parent, and school administrator accounts based on the student associations. An account with no associated students sees no records. System administrator access is gated through the infrastructure's AWS IAM component. The source of approved role-to-privilege relationships originate from the System Description and FIPS 199 Categorization document under Users and Roles.

#### Implementation Status: implemented
