# ac-6.10 - \[Access Control\] Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions

## Control Statement

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

## Control Assessment Objective

non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions.

## Control guidance

Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms. Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions is enforced by [AC-3](#ac-3).

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

Non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions through the role based access control component of the system. Privileged functions are defined in AC-6(1), non-privileged roles do not have access to any privileged functions. System operations are default-deny. Administrative functions fall under the system administrator role, which is only accessible through AWS SSM Session Manager.

#### Implementation Status: implemented
